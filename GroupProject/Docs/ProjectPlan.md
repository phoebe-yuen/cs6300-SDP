## 1. Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a job comparison application on the android platform to help the user compare and assess various job offers.

## 2. Process Description

<p></p>

### **Inception and Elaboration**
Since the application is to be built for a user who wants to collect and compare job offers, the requirements are already defined through project criteria and useful for creation of use case diagrams, UML diagrams and respective reference documents which will define application infrastructure and architecture. Using provided software design and requirements, several document templates outlining requirements will offer guidance on how to use and navigate through our system application.

The estimated level of effort of the project is ~180 hours which consists of efforts to strategize, develop, implement and test the job comparison application.

**Entrance criteria:** Individual UML design drafts, design description, Team UML design, Documentation templates, Final Software design, Requirements

**Exit criteria:** First drafts of documentation templates (project plan, use-case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan)

<p></p>

### **Construction**
After completion of system design, the implementation phase will begin along with technical development of the application. During this phase, technical aspects of the application will be developed such as classes, objects and methods from system design. The team has a principal developer, Kai, and the team will review code and application on Github providing iterative feedback. After incorporating specifications from inception an elaboration phase, a final functional product is to be developed.

**Entrance criteria:** Initial drafts of documentation, Requirements

**Exit criteria:** Updated drafts of documentation templates (project plan, use-case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan, source code), use case traceability information, beta version of the application, user manual

<p></p>

### **Transition**
Upon completion of the system implementation, the testing phase will initiate as the Project manager will set up a prodcedure of several unit test cases to assess code functionality. Such validation tests will be carried out by the team. Once all test cases pass and all bugs are resolved, the application will be released. Tests will be specified in detail within the Test Plan document.

**Entrance criteria:** Updated drafts of documentation templates (project plan, use-case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan, source code), beta version of the application

**Exit criteria:** Final drafts of documentation templates (project plan, use-case model, supplementary requirements, design document, test plan, source code), final version of application, updated documentation
